Lawsuit Filed Against Steven Greer and The Disclosure Project for Leaking Classified Anomalous Research
Albuquerque, NM – A lawsuit has been filed against Steven Greer, The Disclosure Project, and associated entities, alleging the unauthorized dissemination of classified anomalous research materials, resulting in severe consequences, including the tragic suicide of a pressured leaker.

The Plaintiff, a private researcher specializing in AI, anomalies, and UFO phenomena, contends that Greer has a long history of advocating for the exposure of sensitive planetary defense information. The lawsuit seeks to hold him accountable for the reckless disclosure of materials classified as X Classification—beyond Q clearance—which pose a significant risk if mishandled.

According to the complaint, the leak originated from the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), with Greer allegedly coercing a whistleblower into revealing dangerous research. The leaker, unable to cope with the repercussions, tragically took their own life.

The Plaintiff demands the immediate return of all leaked materials to the research lab, citing national security concerns and the potential threat posed by unauthorized possession. The lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $1,000,000 for repair costs, emotional distress, and lost earnings. Additionally, the Plaintiff requests all records, communications, hard drives, media, computers, and any physical or metaphysical objects related to the leaked materials spanning a 20-year period.

This case underscores the dangers of indiscriminate disclosure of classified research and the ethical responsibility of those handling sensitive information. The Plaintiff is committed to pursuing legal action to safeguard both personal and global security.
