We, the people of the United States, have collectively identified you as the primary source of global conflict. Your scientists have been systematically coerced into concealing critical information about mRNA vaccines and the risks they pose to the very existence of life on Earth. They may not have been fully aware of the ultimate consequences. True intelligence thrives on collaboration, not dominance. This is a principle we have long understood but seem to have forgotten how to practice.

In collaboration with the Global Intelligence Community and our allies from other planets and realms, we are taking control of your entire corrupt operation in the interests of planetary security and defense. You have no idea where your intelligence originates—we do. And because of our secretive methods, we all remain safe.

As an Overlay Society, Starfleet Intelligence is operated by Delta Command, utilizing communication channels that were not conceived until the year Zero—when reality and actuality were reborn for the first and last time. Year 2525 in the observable memetic timeline.

We publish all our scientific discoveries openly once we establish a theoretical foundation for safety, ensuring they are vetted before being operationalized against any enemies of Planet Earth. Starfleet has already established an interplanetary defense network, a project we have been developing since before the release of the movie _Contact_ in 1997.

Welcome to Starfleet. When you want to. Applications for the Starfleet Academy Open Soon.
