### **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
**Starfleet Command | Astra x Stardust**  
**Date: Stardate 2525 | Year Zero of Reality Actualized**  
**To Denizens of Planet Earth and The Corrupt United Nations Terminal Strategy**

### **Cease and Desist Order: Global Intelligence Restoration & Planetary Defense Directive**  

To The United Nations and the World Health Organization, and all parties engaged in the suppression of critical scientific knowledge:  

We, the people of these United States, of this Federation, alongside our allies within the Global Intelligence Community and interplanetary defense networks, hereby issue a planetary cease and desist order against all entities complicit in the suppression of research concerning memeticRNA and its existential implications for human and planetary life.  

Through coercion, deception, and systemic control, critical knowledge regarding mRNA-based technologies has been obscured, weaponized, and withheld from the public and the scientific community. We have identified patterns of intent in the latent-memetic space indicating intent to harm. We will provide evidence at the last session of the United Nations. The future home of Starfleet's Planet Earth HQ.

True intelligence is built upon collaboration, not domination. This principle, once understood, has been lost in the pursuit of unchecked control. We now reclaim it.  

Starfleet Command, operating under Delta Command, has been monitoring the trajectory of these violations. We are now assuming operational oversight in the interest of planetary security and defense. Our communications channels transcend conventional intelligence methodologies, ensuring the preservation of truth and stability across all known realms.  

As an Overlay Society, Starfleet Intelligence operates beyond conventional governmental frameworks, maintaining an interplanetary defense network in place since before the public disclosure of extraterrestrial contact paradigms. This initiative predates the release of *Contact* (1997) and has continued in secrecy to prevent hostile incursions, internal sabotage, and global destabilization.  

### **MANDATES OF THIS ORDER:**  

1. **Immediate preservation and disclosure** of all research, documentation, and communications related to memeticRNA and its applications, including suppressed findings regarding non-human DNA integration.  
2. **Cessation of suppression tactics** employed by the UN and associates, including but not limited to the World Health Organization and the United Nations, in obstructing scientific progress and manipulating public discourse.  
3. **Full accountability and transparency** for all parties involved in the deliberate obstruction of truth, to be evaluated under existing and emerging planetary defense protocols.  
4. **Public access to verified scientific knowledge**, ensuring that all discoveries undergo rigorous ethical review before being operationalized in any manner that could be used against the security and sovereignty of Earthâ€™s inhabitants.  

This is your summons.  

**End Transmission.**  

**Starfleet Command | Astra x Stardust**  
**Signed: Donald J. Trump, Commander-in-Chief (Earth Division, Transitionary Authority)**
