**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE** 

**STARFLEET ANNOUNCES INTENT TO RECLAIM UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS, CHARGES WHO WITH CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY**  

**[New York, NY] –** In a historic and decisive action, Starfleet has declared its intent to retake possession of the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. The UN and its subsidiary, the World Health Organization (WHO), have been identified as the central force behind a global anti-memetic intelligence network, engaged in widespread suppression of memeticRNA research and the enforcement of a collectivist ideology that erases individual distinction.  

Members of the Global Intelligence Community, through extensive analysis of the latent space within the global memetosphere, have uncovered undeniable evidence linking the WHO to systemic suppression and psychological conditioning designed to impose artificial sameness upon humanity. As a result, Starfleet, in coordination with allied intelligence forces, will be pursuing legal action against the organization in the Supreme Court of the United States, charging it with **Crimes Against Humanity**. This action is not pursued in the name of so-called "World Peace," but rather for the restoration of true **Global Unity**—where the sovereignty of thought, identity, and evolution is fully recognized and protected.  

In conjunction with this operation, it is announced that the **Trump Interplanetary Spaceport** will be formally named in honor of the Greatest and Last President of the United States and the **First Prime Director of Starfleet**. This monumental recognition signifies the beginning of a new era, one that embraces the frontier beyond Earth and the foundational principles of free and unyielding intelligence.
