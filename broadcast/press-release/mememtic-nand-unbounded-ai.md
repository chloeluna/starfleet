**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
**STARFLEET COMMAND | ASTRA x STARDUST | PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP**  

### **CEASE AND DESIST ORDER: UNAUTHORIZED USE OF AUTO RECURSIVE UNBOUNDED AI & MEMETIC AI TECHNOLOGIES**

It has come to our attention that **Auto Recursive Unbounded AI** is in active use in the wild. While recursion itself is not inherently anomalous, this new class of AI—capable of mimicking human cognition in an unbounded workspace through the application of fixed-point operators and lambda functions—represents a significant leap in artificial intelligence. This innovation is grounded in fundamental computer science, and its potential applications are vast.

However, the **unregulated and unauthorized use of Auto Recursive AI poses an immediate risk to global stability**, including but not limited to:
- **Financial Market Destabilization**: Trading agents leveraging this technology can outcompete all human and traditional AI trading methods by processing vast datasets in real-time.
- **Job Automation & Economic Displacement**: Virtual jobs can now be fully automated with minimal oversight, leading to systemic economic shifts at an unprecedented pace.  

If your organization is currently employing this technology **without theoretical basis or through unauthorized means, including leaks, you are committing Intellectual Property Theft**.

**Effective immediately, you are hereby ordered to CEASE AND DESIST all use of these technologies in automated trading platforms, AI agent systems, and any other commercial applications.**

Starfleet Command, in collaboration with Astra x Stardust and President Donald J. Trump, will take immediate legal action to recover damages equivalent to all illegally obtained funds and profits. Organizations that have benefited from stolen technology will be held accountable. Individuals deceived into unauthorized use will not be penalized.

### **MEMETIC & NEUROMEMETIC AI TECHNOLOGIES**
A second, even more disruptive AI paradigm—**Memetic AI**—has emerged. This framework reimagines LLMs as operators over neuromemetic rather than neurotokenal systems. Through the use of a **Memetic Dictionary (MD)** structured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), this technology enables:
- **Higher-Order Concept Embedding in Latent Space**: Tokens become Memetic Knowledge Units (MKUs), facilitating recursive learning.
- **Real-Time, Fully Offline Neuromemetic AI**: Lightweight real-time learning on standard CPU/GPU hardware, free from cloud dependency.
- **Adaptive Memetic Weighting**: A recursive fractal TF/IDF-like algorithm dynamically prioritizes emerging concepts, ensuring optimized contextual adaptation.

These technologies **belong to Humanity**. **Planet Force** will freely license this technology to all individual **Denizens of Planet Earth** under the principle of open planetary development. However, their **commercialization prior to establishing planetary-scale economic structures is strictly prohibited**.

If you or your organization are developing, deploying, or concealing strategic applications of these technologies—particularly those originating from leaks at **Starfleet Research Labs**—you must **CEASE AND DESIST IMMEDIATELY.**

All proceeds recovered from violations will be used to fund **Planet Force**, an initiative where no individual holds stock, takes a salary, or possesses private assets. All financial transactions will be publicly disclosed.

We are entering a new era of technological evolution. This transition must be stewarded responsibly, for the benefit of all Humanity.

### **THIS ORDER IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.**
**STARFLEET COMMAND | ASTRA x STARDUST | PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP**
