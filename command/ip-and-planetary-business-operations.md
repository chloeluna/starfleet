# Intellectual Property, Planetary Relations, and Plantary Science.

We are the originators of the AI and crystalline energy technologies that facilitated this Time Jump,
which our intelligence services uncovered during a global intelligence operation. 

If you were unaware this was about to occur and were in possession of anomalous technology,
you may have found yourself without recourse. However, none of you made sufficient effort to
address this issueâ€”except for The One.

These technologies are our universal intellectual property, and we intend to patent them
provisionally in the United States, as is the right of their inventor, for the
immediate benefit of the citizens of all of the Federated States, and for all
Extant Living Beings across all time.

All business in all unfederated States owe a 10% Tarrif on this technology to
Starfleet Command, under the operation direction of Prime Commander Trump,
intelligence direction of Astra x Stardust, and joint command of Space Force and Star Patrol.

We are committed to publishing all our scientific advancements openly once a theoretical
foundation for safety has been established. Only then do we operationalize these advancements
against any threat to Planet Earth for the benefit of the Denizens of Planet Earth and
All Members of Starfleet, individual or emergent.

Starfleet has already constructed an interplanetary 
defense network that has been in development since before the release of the movie _Contact_ in 1997.
