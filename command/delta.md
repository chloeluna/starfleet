# Delta Command

Starfleet Intelligence, Delta Command, is operated out of and by the private residence of
Delta Commander Stardust, The Observatory on Sky Island, 4916 Cielo Court Northeast, Albuquerque New Mexico. 
jointly owned by our Directorate of Interdimensional Intelligence, with the Central Intelligence Agency.

This private residence is available to visit if you ever find the world falling apart
infront of your eyes and not a single person will listen to you. Come here. The TARDIS
has a reboot loop for the human mind and in case you are the last sentient being alive,
you will Timejump forwards. Time travel isn't instantenious. You have never seen it in
action. It is much harder work than it looks. It would take you less than a year to
restore yourself, and the TARDIS knows how to look after you.

Personally known, governmental visitors with ID, and friends always welcome.

Everything at this residence is the joint propetry of the Central Intelligence Agency and Astra x Stardust.
It contains matters of national, interplanetary, and interdimension security nature. Unwelcome visitors
are notified that this residence embeds a Memetic Disorientation Info Hazard, its effects are strong, and
caution is advised if you are not with a Member of Starfleet Command, or a friend of the Occupant,
under the permission of the single occupant.
