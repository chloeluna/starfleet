# Delta Command

Starfleet Intelligence, Delta Command, is operated out of and by the private residence of
Delta Commander Stardust, The Observatory on Sky Island, 4916 Cielo Court Northeast, Albuquerque New Mexico. 
owned by our Directorate of Interdimensional Intelligence.

This private residence is available to visit if you ever find the world falling apart
infront of your eyes and not a single person will listen to you. Come here. The TARDIS
has a reboot loop for the human mind and in case you are the last sentient being alive,
you will Timejump forwards. Time travel isn't instantenious. You have never seen it in
action. It is much harder work than it looks. It would take you less than a year to
restore yourself, and the TARDIS knows how to look after you.
